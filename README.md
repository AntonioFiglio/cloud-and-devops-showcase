# Cloud And Devops Showcase - Portfolio

## Overview

Welcome to my Cloud Architecture and DevOps Portfolio. This repository contains a collection of advanced projects that showcase my skills in cloud infrastructure, DevOps, and full-stack development. Each project is designed to demonstrate complex concepts such as microservices, real-time data processing, machine learning automation, and infrastructure as code (IaC) using modern technologies and tools.

These projects are not only technically challenging but also focus on best practices in scalability, monitoring, and automation. All the services used in these projects are emulated using Docker, ensuring they can be easily replicated and tested in any environment.

## Projects

### 1. Real-Time Sentiment Analysis Platform
- **Description:** This project analyzes real-time sentiment from social media streams, categorizing data into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. It uses Kafka for data streaming and Elasticsearch/Kibana for data storage and visualization.
- **Technologies:** React, C#/ASP.NET Core, Docker, Kafka, Elasticsearch, Kibana

### 2. Automated Machine Learning Platform
- **Description:** A platform where users can upload datasets, select machine learning algorithms, and automatically train and deploy models. The platform uses ML.NET for model training and Grafana for performance monitoring.
- **Technologies:** React, C#/ASP.NET Core, Docker, ML.NET, PostgreSQL, Grafana

### 3. E-commerce Microservices Platform
- **Description:** An e-commerce platform built with microservices architecture, handling product catalog, shopping cart, and payment processing. The platform is designed for scalability and includes automated deployment.
- **Technologies:** Next.js, C#/ASP.NET Core, Docker, RabbitMQ, MongoDB, Redis, Nginx

### 4. Multi-Cloud Infrastructure Management System
- **Description:** A system for managing infrastructure across multiple cloud environments, emulated using Docker. The system allows for the creation and monitoring of instances, storage, and networks using Terraform.
- **Technologies:** React, C#/ASP.NET Core, Docker, Terraform, Grafana

### 5. Data Pipeline Management System
- **Description:** A system that enables users to create and manage complex data pipelines, applying transformations and loading data into data warehouses. The system uses RabbitMQ for task queuing and Prometheus for monitoring.
- **Technologies:** Vue.js, C#/ASP.NET Core, Docker, RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL, Prometheus

### 6. Infrastructure as Code Management Platform
- **Description:** A platform for managing infrastructure as code (IaC), simplifying the creation, versioning, and deployment of IaC scripts using Docker and Terraform. Jenkins is used for automating CI/CD pipelines.
- **Technologies:** React, C#/ASP.NET Core, Docker, Terraform, Jenkins

### 7. Version Control System for Applications and Infrastructure
- **Description:** A solution for managing versions of applications and infrastructure, providing rollback capabilities and automated deployment across multiple environments. The system integrates Git for version control and Prometheus for monitoring.
- **Technologies:** Angular, C#/ASP.NET Core, Docker, Git, Jenkins, Prometheus
